### Tuts+ Tutorial: Create Space Invaders with Swift and Sprite Kit: Introducing Sprite Kit
#### Instructor: James Tyner

In this series I will be teaching you how to create a Space Invaders inspired game using Sprite Kit and the Swift programming language. Along the way, you will create several classes, learn about Sprite Kit's integrated physics engine, generate particles using Sprite Kit's built-in particle editor, use the accelerometer to move a player, and much more.
